# README for U-Net with GAN Data Augmentation Project

## Overview
This project implements a U-Net model for image segmentation, utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate additional training data. The GAN-enhanced dataset improves model performance by increasing the variety of training samples. The project includes Jupyter notebooks for model training and evaluation, along with datasets in compressed format.

## Files and Structure
- **`final-u-net-model.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the U-Net model implementation, training, and evaluation.
- **`gan_colab_code.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook for training a GAN model to generate additional dataset samples.
- **`generated_samples.zip`**: Contains synthetic images generated by the GAN to augment the dataset.
- **`resized.zip`**: Preprocessed images resized for model input.
- **`test_set_images.zip`**: Test dataset used for evaluating the U-Net model.
- **`training.zip`**: Training dataset containing labeled images for segmentation.
- **`val_images.zip`**: Validation images used for hyperparameter tuning.
- **`val_masks.zip`**: Corresponding masks for validation images.

## Requirements

### Software:
- **Python** (version 3.8 or higher recommended)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for running the `.ipynb` files)
- **Google Colab** (optional, for training GANs with higher GPU availability)

### Python Packages:
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib opencv-python albumentations
